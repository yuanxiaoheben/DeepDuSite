# DeepDuSite
Method for dU sites prediction
### Pretrained
Using [example link](https://github.com/codertimo/BERT-pytorch  "With a Title")for pretrained, pretrained sequence data could download from UCSC (http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg38/database/cytoBand.txt.gz). The please transfer coodinate to DNA sequence, and then segment them to the corpus of one line with two 400bp adjacent DNA sequences.

### Train
Using bert_pytorch/bert_ensemble_train.py for training
